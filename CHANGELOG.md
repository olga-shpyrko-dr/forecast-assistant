# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- React frontend (`frontend_react/`) served by FastAPI from `forecastic/build`, as an
  alternative to the Streamlit app.
- `FRONTEND_TYPE` setting (`react` | `streamlit`, default `streamlit`) selecting which
  frontend Pulumi deploys.
- React app: choose the scoring dataset from the Data Registry (filtered to the app's
  use case) or upload a new file, instead of only the deploy-time scoring dataset. New
  `GET /registryDatasets` and `POST /datasets/upload` endpoints; filtering is hidden
  while a custom dataset is active and the selected dataset name is shown under
  "Prediction dataset".

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Restored the `datarobotx-idp` dependency dropped in `0.3.3`. It's still required by the model training and scoring-prep notebooks (`datarobotx.idp.use_cases`, `.datasets`, `.autopilot`, `.calendars`, `.registered_model_versions`); only its usage in `infra/__main__.py` was removable.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Generative LLM custom models now submit the full blueprint/DRUM default runtime parameter set explicitly alongside credentials, replacing the previous read-modify-write version merge. The merge only worked when the existing version still carried the defaults, so a deployment already broken by a partial submission couldn't self-repair; explicit submission fixes it on the next `pulumi up`.

### Removed

- Removed the `datarobotx-idp`-based custom model version merge helper from `infra/__main__.py` and the now-unused `datarobotx-idp` dependency.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- Updated the default LLM to Azure OpenAI GPT-5-mini, with README instructions for changing the LLM.

### Fixed

- Fixed generative LLM custom model runtime parameters being overwritten with only the credential values when provider LLM credentials are configured. Credentials are now merged onto the blueprint's default runtime parameters instead of replacing them.

### Fixed

- Fixed DR CLI update

- Added `deploy` task to simplify deployment process.

### Changed

- Updated README.md structure to include Quick Start with DataRobot CLI, Codespace build instructions, and manual setup details.

### Fixed
- Fixed credential handling when no credentials available
