The forecast assistant is a customizable application template for building AI-powered forecasts. In addition to creating a hosted and shareable user interface, the forecast assistant provides: 

* Best-in-class predictive model training and deployment using DataRobot forecasting.
* An intelligent explanation of factors driving the forecast that are uniquely derived for any series at any time.

> [!WARNING]
> Application templates are intended to be starting points that provide guidance on how to develop, serve, and maintain AI applications.
> They require a developer or data scientist to adapt and modify them to meet business requirements before being put into production.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Quickstart with DataRobot CLI

#### 1. Install the DataRobot CLI

If you haven't already, install the DataRobot CLI by following the installation instructions at:  
https://github.com/datarobot-oss/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

#### 2. Start the Application

Run the following command to start the local development environment. An interactive wizard will guide you through the selection of configuration options, including creating a `.env` file in the root directory and populating it with environment variables you specify during the wizard.

```sh
dr start
```

The DataRobot CLI (`dr`) will:
- Guide you through configuration setup
- Create and populate your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables
- Deploy your application to DataRobot
- Display a link to your running application when complete

When deployment completes, the terminal will display a link to your running application.  
👉 **Click the link to open and start using your app!**

### Build in Codespace

If you're using **DataRobot Codespace**, everything you need is already installed.
Follow the steps below to launch the entire application in just a few minutes.

Use the built-in terminal on the left sidebar of the Codespace.

From the project root:

```sh
dr start
```

When deployment completes, the terminal will display a link to your running application.\
👉 **Click the link to open and start using your app!**

### Template Development

For local development, follow all of the steps below.

#### 1. Install Pulumi (if you don't have it yet)

If Pulumi is not already installed, follow the installation instructions in the Pulumi [documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/).
After installing for the first time, **restart your terminal** and run:

```sh
pulumi login --local      # omit --local to use Pulumi Cloud (requires an account)
```

#### 2. Clone the Template Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datarobot-community/forecast-assistant.git
cd forecast-assistant
```

#### 3. Create and Populate Your `.env` File
Run the following command to launch an interactive wizard that helps you create and populate your `.env` file based on `.env.template` and walks you through the required credentials setup.
```sh
dr dotenv setup
```
If you want to locate the credentials manually:

- DataRobot API Token:
  See Create a DataRobot API Key in the [DataRobot API Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#create-a-datarobot-api-key).

- DataRobot Endpoint:
  See Retrieve the API Endpoint in the same [Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#retrieve-the-api-endpoint).

- LLM Endpoint & API Key (Azure OpenAI):
  This template is pre-configured to use an Azure OpenAI endpoint. If you wish to use a different provider, see [Change the LLM](#change-the-llm).

#### 4. Run the Application

In a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python quickstart.py YOUR_PROJECT_NAME  # Windows users may have to use `py` instead of `python`
```
Python 3.12+ is required.

Advanced users who want to control virtual environment creation, dependency installation, environment variable setup,
and `pulumi` invocation, see [the advanced setup instructions](#setup-for-advanced-users).


## Choosing your setup

Before your first `pulumi up` (or `dr start` / `python quickstart.py`), there are three independent choices worth making deliberately. All of them are just `.env` or `infra/settings_generative.py` edits — you can change any of them later and re-run `pulumi up` to update the same stack.

### 1. Front-end: React or Streamlit

Set `FRONTEND_TYPE` in `.env` — `react` or `streamlit` (default: `streamlit` if unset).

Both options are served by the **same** Pulumi stack, the **same** `forecastic/` backend, and deploy to the **same** Custom Application resource — switching is just changing the value and re-running `pulumi up`. There's no need to run two separate stacks unless you specifically want both frontends live at once (see [Change the front-end](#change-the-front-end) for how to do that with `pulumi stack init`).

| | `FRONTEND_TYPE=streamlit` | `FRONTEND_TYPE=react` |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `frontend/` | `frontend_react/react_src/` |
| Extra build step | None | **Yes** — must run `cd frontend_react/react_src && yarn install && yarn build` before `pulumi up` (builds the SPA into `forecastic/build/`, which FastAPI serves) |
| Charting | Server-rendered Plotly (`forecastic/api.py::get_forecast_as_plotly_json`) | Client-side charts (`visx`/`d3`) |
| Filtering | Server-side | Client-side |

See [Change the front-end](#change-the-front-end) for details.

### 2. LLM: build from credentials, or attach an existing deployment

Configured in `infra/settings_generative.py` and `.env`:

- **Build from credentials (default)** — `LLM = LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_5_MINI` (or any other `LLMs.*` member for AWS Bedrock / Google Vertex AI / etc.). Provide that provider's credentials in `.env` (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_BASE` for Azure). Pulumi automatically provisions a governed Playground → LLM Blueprint → Custom Model → Deployment chain from those credentials — nothing to deploy yourself.
- **Attach an existing deployment** — `LLM = LLMs.DEPLOYED_LLM`, plus either `TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID` or `TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID` in `.env`. No new generative model gets built; the app just points at what you already have.
- **Disable entirely** — `LLM = None`. No generative resources are provisioned and the AI-commentary toggle in the app is greyed out.

See [Change the LLM](#change-the-llm), [Add a new LLM](#add-a-new-llm), and [Disable the LLM](#disable-the-llm).

### 3. Training vs. deployment mode

Controlled entirely by `.env` vars — each one independently lets you skip a step of the default from-scratch pipeline (train a new model from a local CSV, then prep scoring data from a local CSV):

| Variable | Effect when set |
|---|---|
| `FORECAST_DEPLOYMENT_ID` | Skip model training entirely; reuse an existing forecast deployment (metadata is extracted from it). No batch prediction job or retraining policy gets created. |
| `TRAINING_DATASET_ID` | Skip the local CSV read/upload in `train_model.ipynb`; train against a dataset already in the AI Catalog. |
| `FORECAST_SCORING_DATASET_ID` | Skip `prep_scoring_data.ipynb` entirely; score against a dataset already in the AI Catalog. |

These three are independent — e.g. you can train a new model from an existing `TRAINING_DATASET_ID` while still scoring from a fresh local CSV. See [Use an existing forecast deployment](#use-an-existing-forecast-deployment).

## Architecture overview
![Forecast assistant](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datarobot_public/drx/recipe_gifs/forecast-assistant-diagram.svg)

App Templates contain three families of complementary logic. For this template, you can [opt-in](#make-changes) to fully 
custom AI logic and a fully custom front-end or utilize DataRobot's off-the-shelf offerings:

- **AI logic**: Necessary to service AI requests, generate predictions, and manage predictive models.
  ```
  notebooks/  # Model training logic, scoring data prep logic
  ```
- **App logic**: Necessary for user consumption, whether via a hosted front-end or integrating into an external consumption layer.
  ```
  frontend/               # Streamlit frontend
  frontend_react/react_src/  # React frontend (see FRONTEND_TYPE)
  forecastic/             # App biz logic & runtime helpers, shared by both frontends
  ```
- **Operational logic**: Necessary to turn on all DataRobot assets.
  ```
  infra/  # Settings for resources and assets to be created in DataRobot
  infra/__main__.py  # Pulumi program for configuring DataRobot to serve and monitor AI and App logic
  ```


## Why build AI Apps with DataRobot app templates?

App templates transform your AI projects from notebooks to production-ready applications. Too often, getting models into production means rewriting code, juggling credentials, and coordinating with multiple tools and teams just to make simple changes. DataRobot's composable AI apps framework eliminates these bottlenecks, letting you spend more time experimenting with your ML and app logic and less time wrestling with plumbing and deployment.

- Start building in minutes: Deploy complete AI applications instantly, then customize AI logic or front-end independently - no architectural rewrites needed.
- Keep working your way: Data scientists keep working in notebooks, developers in IDEs, and configs stay isolated - update any piece without breaking others.
- Iterate with confidence: Make changes locally and deploy with confidence - spend less time writing and troubleshooting plumbing, more time improving your app.

Each template provides an end-to-end AI architecture, from raw inputs to deployed application, while remaining highly customizable for specific business requirements.

## Make changes

### Change the data and how the model is trained
1. Edit the following two notebooks:
   - `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`: Handles training data ingest and preparation and model training settings.
   - `notebooks/prep_scoring_data.ipynb`: Handles scoring data preparation (the data used to show forecasts in the front-end).
   
   The last cell of each notebook is required, as it writes outputs needed for the rest of the pipeline.

**Recent improvements in `train_model.ipynb`:**
- **Dual-mode operation**: The notebook now supports both training new models and using existing deployments
- **Automatic metadata extraction**: When using an existing deployment, the notebook automatically extracts model metadata (target, datetime partition column, etc.)
- **Flexible feature configuration**: Easy configuration of known-in-advance features for what-if analysis
- **Error handling**: Improved error handling with fallback mechanisms for missing model metadata

2. Run the revised notebooks.
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack with these changes.
```bash
source set_env.sh  # On windows use `set_env.bat`
pulumi up
```  
4. For a forecasting app that is continuously updated, consider running `prep_scoring_data.ipynb` on a schedule.

### Disable the LLM
In `infra/settings_generative.py`: Set `LLM=None` to disable any generative output altogether.

### Use an existing forecast deployment

To use an existing forecast deployment instead of creating a new one:

1. In `.env`: Set `FORECAST_DEPLOYMENT_ID` to the ID of your existing deployment
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack with the existing deployment
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

> **⚠️ Note:** When using an existing deployment:
> - The script will skip creating batch prediction jobs and retraining policies  
> - The `train_model.ipynb` notebook will skip training and extract metadata from the existing model
> - You may need to adjust the `feature_settings_config` in the notebook to match your model's known-in-advance features

**Files that need modification for existing deployments:**

When using an existing deployment, you may need to modify these files to match your model's configuration:

1. **`notebooks/train_model.ipynb`** - Update the `feature_settings_config` to match your model's known-in-advance features:
   ```python
   feature_settings_config=[
       FeatureSettingConfig(feature_name="Your_Feature_Name", known_in_advance=True),
       # Add other known-in-advance features from your model
   ]
   ```

2. **`notebooks/prep_scoring_data.ipynb`** - Ensure your scoring data preparation matches the data format expected by your existing model

3. **`forecastic/schema.py`** - Update app settings if your model has different features or requirements

**What happens when using an existing deployment:**

- **Model Training**: Completely skipped - no new model is trained
- **Data Ingestion**: Skipped - uses existing model's training data
- **Metadata Extraction**: The notebook extracts target, datetime partition column, and other model metadata from your existing deployment
- **Resource Creation**: Only creates the application frontend and LLM components (if enabled)
- **Batch Prediction**: Not created (you'll need to set up your own if needed)
- **Retraining Policy**: Not created (you'll need to set up your own if needed)

### Use an existing AI Catalog dataset for training or scoring

Independent of `FORECAST_DEPLOYMENT_ID` above, you can skip the local-CSV steps of the pipeline while still training a new model:

- `TRAINING_DATASET_ID` — skips the local CSV read/upload in `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`; trains against a dataset already registered in the AI Catalog.
- `FORECAST_SCORING_DATASET_ID` — skips running `notebooks/prep_scoring_data.ipynb` entirely; scores against a dataset already in the AI Catalog. This is the dataset used at deploy time — it's distinct from swapping datasets at runtime in the app UI (React only; see the in-app "Change dataset" picker) or replaying a previous dataset *version* (both front-ends; see the "Prediction Timestamp" selector).

Set either in `.env`, then run `pulumi up` as usual.

### Change the LLM

1. Modify the `LLM` setting in `infra/settings_generative.py` (default: `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_5_MINI`) by changing it to any other LLM from the `LLMs` object.
     - Trial users: Please set `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_4_O_MINI` since GPT-4o is not supported in the trial. Use the `OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID` in `.env` to override which model is used in your azure organisation. You'll still see GPT 4o-mini in the playground, but the deployed app will use the provided azure deployment.  
2. To use an existing TextGen model or deployment:
      - In `infra/settings_generative.py`: Set `LLM=LLMs.DEPLOYED_LLM`.
      - In `.env`: Set either the `TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID` or the `TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID`
      - In `.env`: Set `CHAT_MODEL_NAME` to the model name expected by the deployment (e.g. "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" for an anthropic deployment, "datarobot-deployed-llm" for NIM models ) 
3. In `.env`: If not using an existing TextGen model or deployment, provide the required credentials dependent on your choice.
4. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or rerun your quickstart).
      ```bash
      source set_env.sh  # On windows use `set_env.bat`
      pulumi up
      ```

> **⚠️ Availability information:**  
> Using a NIM model requires custom model GPU inference, a premium feature. You will experience errors by using this type of model without the feature enabled. Contact your DataRobot representative or administrator for information on enabling this feature.

### Add a new LLM

If the LLM you want to use isn't already defined in the `LLMs` object, you can register it manually using `LLMConfig`.

1. Find the ID of the LLM you want to add by running the following in a Python session:

   ```python
   import datarobot
   print('\n'.join([i['id'] for i in datarobot.genai.LLMDefinition.list()]))
   ```

2. In `infra/settings_generative.py`, add `LLMConfig` to the existing import and register the new LLM before the `LLM =` assignment:

   ```python
   from datarobot_pulumi_utils.schema.llms import (
       LLMBlueprintArgs,
       LLMConfig,
       LLMs,
       LLMSettings,
       PlaygroundArgs,
   )

   LLMs.YOUR_LLM_NAME = LLMConfig(name="YOUR_LLM_ID", credential_type="azure")
   LLM = LLMs.YOUR_LLM_NAME
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_LLM_NAME` with a descriptive attribute name and `YOUR_LLM_ID` with the ID from step 1.

3. In `utils/credentials.py`, add a mapping from the new LLM name to its Azure deployment name inside the `get_credentials` function:

   ```python
   LLMs.YOUR_LLM_NAME.name: "YOUR_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME",
   ```

4. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack.

   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

### Change the front-end

This template ships **two** front-ends — a Streamlit app (`frontend/`) and a React SPA (`frontend_react/react_src/`) — sharing one `forecastic/` backend and one Pulumi stack. `FRONTEND_TYPE` in `.env` (`react` or `streamlit`, default `streamlit`) selects which one gets bundled into the deployed Custom Application.

**To switch which one is deployed:**
1. Set `FRONTEND_TYPE=react` or `FRONTEND_TYPE=streamlit` in `.env`.
2. If switching to `react`, build the SPA first — Pulumi does not do this for you:
   ```bash
   cd frontend_react/react_src
   yarn install
   yarn build   # outputs into ../../forecastic/build/, served by FastAPI
   cd ../..
   ```
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack with the change.
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

**To run a front-end locally** (after `pulumi up` has provisioned the time series deployment at least once):
- Streamlit: `source set_env.sh && cd frontend && streamlit run app.py`
- React: `cd frontend_react/react_src && yarn dev` (dev server proxies API calls to the FastAPI backend; see `frontend_react/react_src/src/api/apiClient.ts`)

> **📡 Ports, if running in a fresh DataRobot Codespace:** these dev servers bind to specific ports, and a new Codespace won't have them forwarded/enabled by default — you'll need to enable each one before it's reachable from your browser:
> - Streamlit: **8501**
> - React: **8080** (FastAPI backend, `uvicorn forecastic.rest_api:app --port 8080`) **and** **5173** (Vite dev server, `yarn dev`) — you browse to 5173; it proxies API calls to 8080 internally.
>
> Only enable the port(s) for the mode you're actually running.

**To test both front-ends side by side** instead of toggling one stack back and forth, use a second Pulumi stack:
```bash
pulumi stack init react-test   # or any name
# set FRONTEND_TYPE accordingly in .env, then:
pulumi up
```
Each stack provisions its own use case, deployment, and Custom Application — expect real, separate DataRobot resources per stack, not a preview.

#### Change the language in the front-end
Optionally, you can set the application locale in `forecastic/i18n.py`, e.g. `APP_LOCALE = LanguageCode.JA`. Supported locales are Japanese and English, with English set as the default.

#### Application resources
The application now supports inheriting resource configurations from the Application Source. When the Application Source is created, the system automatically fetches its resource settings (replicas, memory, CPU) via the DataRobot API and applies them to the Custom Application.

**How it works:**
1. The Application Source is created with its resource configuration
2. The system fetches the source's resource details using `application_source.id`
3. These resources are automatically applied to the Custom Application

**Environment variables required:**
- `DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT`: Your DataRobot API endpoint
- `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`: Your DataRobot API token

**Fallback behavior:**
- If resources cannot be fetched from the Application Source, the system falls back to DataRobot's automatic resource allocation
- Error messages are logged as warnings, ensuring deployment continues successfully

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

**Required for all deployments:**
- `DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT`: Your DataRobot API endpoint (e.g., `https://app.datarobot.com`)
- `DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN`: Your DataRobot API token

**Optional — front-end selection:**
- `FRONTEND_TYPE`: `react` or `streamlit` (default: `streamlit`). See [Choosing your setup](#choosing-your-setup) and [Change the front-end](#change-the-front-end).

**Optional for existing deployments/datasets:**
- `FORECAST_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: ID of an existing forecast deployment to reuse instead of creating a new one
- `TRAINING_DATASET_ID`: ID of an existing AI Catalog dataset to train against, skipping local CSV upload
- `FORECAST_SCORING_DATASET_ID`: ID of an existing AI Catalog dataset to score against, skipping `prep_scoring_data.ipynb`
- `TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID`: ID of an existing registered model for LLM functionality
- `TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: ID of an existing LLM deployment for LLM functionality
- `CHAT_MODEL_NAME`: Model name for LLM deployments (e.g., "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "datarobot-deployed-llm")

**Optional for LLM providers:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (for OpenAI LLMs)
- `OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: Azure OpenAI deployment ID (for Azure OpenAI)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic API key (for Claude models)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Google API key (for Google LLMs)

**Optional for advanced configuration:**
- `DATAROBOT_DEFAULT_USE_CASE`: Use case ID to associate with the project

## Share results
1. Log into the DataRobot application.
2. Navigate to **Registry > Applications**.
3. Navigate to the application you want to share, open the actions menu, and select **Share** from the dropdown.

## Delete all provisioned resources
```bash
pulumi down
```
Then run the jupyter notebook `notebooks/delete_non_pulumi_assets.ipynb`.

## Setup for advanced users
For manual control over the setup process, adapt the following steps for MacOS/Linux to your environent:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
source set_env.sh
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up 
```
e.g., for Windows/conda/cmd.exe the previous example would change to the following:
```bash
conda create --prefix .venv pip
conda activate .\.venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
set_env.bat
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up 
```
For projects that will be maintained, DataRobot recommends forking the repo so upstream fixes and improvements can be merged in the future.
